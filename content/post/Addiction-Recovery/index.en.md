This note is from the video [心河擺渡-成瘾始于痛苦，戒瘾终于平衡！深度解读多巴胺，用身体内稳态戒瘾](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbbyLeR1ZRk) The video contains insights from the author as well as his analysis of Anna Lembke's book [Drug Dealer, MD: How Doctors Were Duped, Patients Got Hooked, and Why It’s So Hard to Stop.](https://www.amazon.com/Drug-Dealer-MD-Doctors-Patients/dp/1421421402) The content is very useful, and I made notes to remind myself.

## Underlying Principles
* The reason behind addiction is the increase in dopamine.
    * Chocolate increases it by 55%.
    * Nicotine raises it by 150%.
    * Amphetamine boosts it by 1000%.
* The main role of dopamine is not to make us feel happy after receiving a reward but to drive people to seek rewards.
    * For example, when you see chocolate, dopamine activates the brain's reward circuit, making you feel pleasure even before having it and prompting you to eat it.
* The regions in the brain responsible for pleasure and pain overlap.
    * Pleasure and pain have self-regulating functions. When you're currently experiencing pleasure, the brain will generate enough pain on the other side to balance it out.
* Reward Prediction Error
    * Due to neural adaptation, the actual reward must exceed expectations to have a positive dopamine effect.
    * In severe addiction, the threshold for feeling pleasure increases, resulting in a lack of enjoyment.

## Utilizing the Dopamine Mechanism
* According to clinical experience, recreating the brain's reward circuit takes at least a month.
* Using pain to treat pain
    * The brain uses pain to balance out pleasure and vice versa.
        * According to research, dopamine levels in the blood plasma increase by 250% when people immerse themselves in cold water, and this effect lasts longer than the immersion time.
    * Exercise is the best option.
* Physical separation
    * Completely separate from the addictive substance.
* Radical honesty
    * The prefrontal cortex is responsible for rational decision-making.
    * When the dopamine reward circuit is active, lying inhibits the prefrontal cortex's function, releasing the restraint on the reward circuit, leading the brain to believe it's not addicted.
    * An essential part of addiction recovery is rebuilding the relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the dopamine circuit.
    * Strengthen the prefrontal cortex by "telling the truth" and enhance self-control.
        * During addiction, engage in self-talk or announce your addiction to people around you.
